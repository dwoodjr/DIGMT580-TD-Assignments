# Assignment 2

Attempted to make a maya standalone python script that created a cylinder and saved it to a new maya ascii file called cylinder.ma. The Script will work in maya, but not in standalone. I could not figure out the argeparse passing of arguments correctly. Running from CMD throws DLL and NoModuleFound errors after many attempts to set the proper PYTONPATH and other environemnt paths.
